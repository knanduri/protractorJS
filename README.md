# protractorJS
This is a protractor framework with Jasmine using webdriverJS


Below are the Steps to run the tests

 Step 1
 Run "npm run webdriver" in the terminal - this will trigger the webdriver manager

 Step 2
 Now, In a seperate terminal tab - Run "npm run protractor" - this will run the tests specified in the conf.js which is the configuration file for protractor
 The seperate terminal tab is required because the webdriver session triggered in the Step 1 needs to be maintained for the tests to run
